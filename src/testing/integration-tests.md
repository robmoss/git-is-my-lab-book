# Integration tests

Integration tests are the next step up from unit tests. 
Unit tests individual units of code, ensuring that your functions work as expected. 
Integration tests check your code when you "integrate" your pieces of code together. 

For example, you may be have written a library of functions that you have applied unit tests too.
You have 100% pass rate and great testing coverage within your code base.
However, now its time to use your code in a wider simulation or application. 
It could be plausible that your code base clashes with other components of code that you have written. 
Integration tests are used to help understand this.
