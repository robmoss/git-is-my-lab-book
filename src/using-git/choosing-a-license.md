# Choosing a license

A license specifies the conditions under which others may use, modify, and/or distribute your work.

```admonish info
Simply making a repository publicly accessible is **not sufficient** to allow others to make use of your work.
Unless you include a license that specifies otherwise, [nobody else](https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/) can copy, distribute, or modify your work.
```

There are many different types of licenses that you can use, and the number of options can seem overwhelming.
But it is usually straightforward to narrow down your options.

- If you're working on an **existing project**, the easiest option is to use that project's license.

- If you're working with an **existing community**, they may have a [preferred license](https://choosealicense.com/community/).

- If you want to choose an **open source license**, the [Choose an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/) website  provides advice for selecting a license that meets your needs.
