# Effective use of git

This section shows how to use the `git` command-line program to record your work, to inspect your commit history, and to search this commit history to identify commits that make specific changes or have specific effects.

```admonish tip "Reminder"
Remember to [commit early and commit often](../version-control/what-should-I-commit.md).
**Do not wait** until your code is "perfect".
```
