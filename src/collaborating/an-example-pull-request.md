# An example pull request

The initial draft of each chapter in this section were proposed in a [pull request](https://github.com/robmoss/git-is-my-lab-book/pull/8).

When this pull request was created, the branch added four new commits:

```text
85594bf Add some guidelines for collaboration workflows
678499b Discuss coding style guides
2b9ff70 Discuss merge/pull requests and peer code review
6cc6f54 Discuss repository structure and licenses
```

and the author (Rob Moss) asked the reviewer (Eamon Conway) to address several details in particular.

Eamon made several suggestions in their [initial response](https://github.com/robmoss/git-is-my-lab-book/pull/8#issuecomment-1139216530), including:

- Moving the [How to structure a repository](../using-git/how-to-structure-a-repository.md) and [Choosing a license](../using-git/choosing-a-license.md) chapters to the [Effective use of git](../using-git/) section;

- Starting this section with the [Collaborating on code](collaborating-on-code.md) chapter; and

- Agreeing that we should use [this pull request](https://github.com/robmoss/git-is-my-lab-book/pull/8) as an example in this book.

In response, Rob pushed two commits that addressed the first two points above:

```text
e1d1dd9 Move collaboration guidelines to the start
3f78ef8 Move the repository structure and license chapters
```

and then wrote this chapter to show how **we used [a pull request](https://github.com/robmoss/git-is-my-lab-book/pull/8) to draft this book section**.
