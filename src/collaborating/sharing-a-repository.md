# Sharing a repository

The easiest way to share a repository with collaborators is to have a single remote repository that all collaborators can access.
This repository could be located on a platform such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, or on a platform provided by your University or Institute.

Theses platforms allow you to create **public** repositories and **private** repositories.

- Everybody can view the contents of a public repository.

- You control who can view the contents of a private repository.

- For both types of repository, **you control who can make changes** to the repository, such as creating commits and branches.

```admonish info
You should decide whether a public repository or a private repository suits you best.

## Giving collaborators access to your remote repository

The steps required to do this differ depending on which platform you are using.
Here, we will describe how to give collaborators access to a repository on GitHub.
For further details, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

- Open the main page of your GitHub repository.

- Click on the "Settings" tab in the top navigation bar.

- Click on the "Collaborators" item in the left sidebar.

- Click on the "Add people" button.

- Search for collaborators by entering their GitHub user name, their full name, or their email address.

- Click the "Add <NAME> to this repository" button.

This will send an invitation to the collaborator.
If they accept this invitation, they will have access to your repository.
