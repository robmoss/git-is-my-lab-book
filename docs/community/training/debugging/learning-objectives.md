# Learning objectives

In this workshop, we will introduce the concept of "debugging", and demonstrate techniques and tools that can help us efficiently identify and remove errors from our code.

After completing this workshop, participants will:

+ Understand that debugging can be divided into a sequence of actions;

+ Understand the purpose of each of these actions;

+ Be familiar with techniques and tools that can help perform these actions;

+ Be able to apply these techniques and tools to their own code.
