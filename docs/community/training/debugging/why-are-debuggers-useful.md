# Why are debuggers useful?

!!! tip

    A debugger is a tool for examining the state of a running program.

    Debuggers are useful because they show us what the code **is actually doing**.

Many of the errors that take a long time for us to find are relatively simple **once we find them**.

We usually have a hard time finding these errors because:

1. **We read what we expect to see**, rather than what is actually written; and

2. **We rely on assumptions** about where the mistake might be, and our intuition is often wrong.

Here are some common mistakes that can be difficult to identify when reading through your own code:

- Using an incorrect index into an array, matrix, list, etc;

- Using incorrect bounds on a loop or sequence;

- Confusing the digit "1" with letter "l";

- Confusing the digit "0" with letter "O".
