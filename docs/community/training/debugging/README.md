# Introduction to Debugging

This workshop was prepared for the [SPECTRUM](https://spectrum.edu.au/) Annual Meeting 2024 (23-25 September).

!!! tip

    **We all make mistakes** when writing code and introduce errors.

    Having good debugging skills means that you can spend **less time fixing your code**.

See the discussion in our [August 2024 meeting](../../meetings/2024-08-08.md#debugging) for further background.
