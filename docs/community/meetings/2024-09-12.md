# 12 September 2024

In this meeting we did a test run through our **Introduction to Debugging** workshop, prior to running this workshop at the SPECTRUM Annual Meeting (23â€“25 September, 2024).

Attendance: 3 in person, 7 online

## Introduction to Debugging workshop

Feedback was generally positive.
However, attendees noted that the errors in the provided code exercises were simple enough that they could be identified without using a debugger.

- We may need code examples that are more complex, to ensure that participants actually need to use a debugger.

    - The final exercise may be sufficiently complex?

    - We might also include an SIR-type compartmental model with some logic errors (although these can be hard to hide!).

- We can also ask participants to practice using a debugger with a code example **where there is no error**.

Based on her past experiences, Nefel suggested including an example of triggering a breakpoint only when an error occurs (e.g., using a `try` statement in Python and calling `breakpoint()` in an `except` clause).
