# Community of Practice

!!! info

    *Communities of Practice* are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.

    The community acts as a **living curriculum** and involves **learning on the part of everyone**.

The aim of a *Community of Practice* (*CoP*) is to come together as a community and engage in a process of **collective learning** in a shared domain.
The [three characteristics](https://www.communityofpractice.ca/background/what-is-a-community-of-practice/) of a *CoP* are:

1. Community: An environment for learning through interaction;

2. Practice: Specific knowledge shared by community members; and

3. Domain: A shared interest, problem, or concern.

We regularly meet as a community, report [meeting summaries](meetings/README.md), and collect [case studies](case-studies/README.md) that showcase good practices.
