# Orientation

One of [our goals for 2024](../community/meetings/2024-02-19.md#orientation-materials) is to develop orientation materials for new students, postdocs, etc.
There was broad interest in having a checklist, and example workflows for people to follow — particularly for projects that involve some form of code "hand over", to ensure that the recipients experience few problems in running the code themselves.

Suggested topics included:

- How to set up common tools on your laptop (e.g., Python and R);
- How to [organise your files](../guides/using-git/how-to-structure-a-repository.md);

- How to set up git [on your own device](../guides/using-git/README.md) and [using platforms such as GitHub](../guides/collaborating/README.md);
- How to recover [old versions of files](../guides/using-git/inspecting-your-history.md);
- How to make your code device-agnostic, so it can run on HPC platforms, virtual machines, and can easily be migrated to new devices; and
- How to plan for reproducibility from the beginning, rather than waiting until you're preparing a publication.

!!! note
